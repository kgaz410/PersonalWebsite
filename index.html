        <p id="p1"> Hey there, My name is Kelsey.</p>

        <p id="p2">I was born and raised in a small town located in southwest Georgia. After highschool graduation, I moved to Jacksonville,
        Florida where I pursued a degree in biology. In spring of 2018, I graduated college with a Bachelor's in Science and landed 
        a job in the field of a federal contractor for the Department of Defense. The career field I thought I was going to be in forever, well density has something different in store for me.
        Presently, I am a military wife, a dog mom to two sweet pups, and a full time student apsiring to build a career in web development.</p>
