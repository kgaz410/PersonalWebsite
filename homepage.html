<h2>About Me</h2>

<p id="p1"> Hello Everyone, My name is Kelsey and I am an aspiring web developer.</p>

<!-- CHANGE PARAGRAPHS just placeholders-->
<p id="p2">I was born and raised in a small town located in southwest Georgia. After highschool graduation, I moved to Jacksonville,
Florida where I pursued a degree in biology. In spring of 2018, I graduated college with a Bachelor's in Science and landed 
a job in the field of a federal contractor for the department of defense. </p>
    
<p id="p3">I was born in Kansas, and like little Ellie, I always dreamed that a hurricane would take me somewhere to another country. 
    And once I really ended up in another country - in China, studying at a business school. There I began to travel a lot around Asia in my free time and then moved to work in Munich.</p>
